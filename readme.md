# FeathersJS Blog ü¶Ü

## Heroku demo: https://featherjs-blog.herokuapp.com/

Decided to try out FeathersJS, a Node web framework, and build an app with it. I haven't really ventured outside of Express yet, so this would be my first.

### Here are some of my thoughts on FeathersJS based on initial impressions:

‚úÖ Advantages:
- Simple service set up and hooks integration
- Does a lot of the heavy lifting, especially when it comes to authentication and passport strategies
- When working with the feathers-mongoose module, I liked that clientside requests looked similar to database/mongoose calls, made it easier to develop from the front
- Great documentation
- Open sourced, so I found most solutions online from others

‚ùå Disadvantages:
- Some parts like routing might have been too abstracted. I can see this being a problem for newcomers to the framework.
- Overwhelming amount of feathers-related modules (ie. client, server, and helper libraries). Hard to understand what you need.
- Definitely is overlooked by more popular libraries like Express, Meteor, Sails, Koa.
